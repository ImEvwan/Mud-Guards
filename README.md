# Mud-Guards

Printed in Ranki brand 98a TPU. This stuff prints very well. Clamps and everything are designed to be zero tollerance since they're printed out of TPU. Stock clamps are for 20mmR6 hangers. 100% infil. Those were designed by @Jack_luis for his parametric mudguards. Everything is friction fit on, it's pretty damn tight so I dont anticipate it coming loose while riding. 

I printed the arms out of PETG-CF, but any stiff material will work here. I seriously recommend something strong, the PETG-CF didn't last all that long. My next batch is going to be made of metal. 4x M4x25 bolts for the clamps, 2x M4x10 for the fender.
